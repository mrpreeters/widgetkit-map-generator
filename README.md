# Widgetki Map Generator


### What is it?

Widgetki Map Generator is a program that creates json for the locations that YooTheme's WidgetKit need to display a map.

### How does it work?

The program uses two files  - an input file with names, latitudes and longitudes seperated by a semicolon each in its own line - see example - creates an output file json.txt with all of the locations  In current version it's not possible to pass any other arguments, so you have to copy/paste it into your database, however I plan to develop this project further on

### What does it do?

  - parses locations data form input
  - creates a json record
  - writes it to a txt file


### Version

Run the program from command line, file data_input.txt has to be in the same directory

### Todo's
